QUESTION : So if i want a persistant connection with example.com I will send connection : keep-alive but this connection will 
      remain persistant only with the client and the next hop? and this hop will always make new connections with the s
      erver?is it right??


ANSWER :
Your understanding is close but needs a slight adjustment regarding how persistent connections work with proxies and servers.

#Persistent Connections with `Connection: keep-alive`

When you send a request with `Connection: keep-alive` to example.com through a proxy, here's what happens:

1. Client to Proxy:
   - The client includes `Connection: keep-alive` in the request.
   - This indicates that the client wants to keep the connection to the proxy open for possible future requests.

2. Proxy Behavior:
   - The proxy reads the `Connection: keep-alive` header and understands that the client wants to keep the connection open.
   - The proxy removes the `Connection: keep-alive` header before forwarding the request to the server (example.com) because 
           connection-specific headers are not meant to be forwarded.
   - The proxy can then decide whether to open a new connection to the server or reuse an existing one, 
         if it has one open. This behavior depends on the proxy's own connection management policy and 
         whether it also uses persistent connections.

3. Proxy to Server:
   - If the proxy uses persistent connections, it might send the request to the server with `Connection: keep-alive` to keep 
         that connection open as well.
   - The server can respond with `Connection: keep-alive` to indicate it will keep the connection open for further requests from the proxy.



#Persistent Connections in Practice

- Client-Proxy Connection:
  - The client maintains a persistent connection with the proxy, allowing it to send multiple requests over the same connection.

- Proxy-Server Connection:
  - The proxy may maintain a separate persistent connection with the server, allowing it to send multiple requests 
          to the server over the same connection.
  - The proxy handles connection management between the client and itself, as well as between itself and the server.




#Example Scenario

1. Client Request:
   
                       GET /example HTTP/1.1
                       Host: www.example.com
                       Connection: keep-alive
  
   - The client indicates it wants to keep the connection with the proxy open.

2. Proxy Forwarding:
   - The proxy receives the request, processes it, and forwards it to the server.
   - The forwarded request to the server might look like:

                     GET /example HTTP/1.1
                     Host: www.example.com
                     Connection: keep-alive

   - If the proxy also wants to keep the connection with the server open, it includes `Connection: keep-alive`.

3. Server Response:
   - The server responds with:
     
                       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                       Connection: keep-alive
    
   - This indicates the server will keep the connection open for further requests from the proxy.

4. Proxy Response to Client:
   - The proxy forwards the response back to the client, including the `Connection: keep-alive` header if it wants to keep the 
           connection with the client open.

#Summary

Your initial statement was almost correct. 
The `Connection: keep-alive` header ensures a persistent connection between the client and the proxy. 
The proxy then manages its connection to the server independently, potentially also using persistent connections. 
This way, both the client-proxy connection and the proxy-server connection can be persistent, but they are managed separately.
