                  14.11 Content-Encoding


The Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the
   media-type. When present, its value indicates what additional content
   codings have been applied to the entity-body, and thus what decoding
   mechanisms must be applied in order to obtain the media-type
   referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is
   primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without losing
   the identity of its underlying media type.

       Content-Encoding  = "Content-Encoding" ":" 1#content-coding

   Content codings are defined in section 3.5. An example of its use is

       Content-Encoding: gzip
