              14.13 Content-Length

The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the
   entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or,
   in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that
   would have been sent had the request been a GET.

       Content-Length    = "Content-Length" ":" 1*DIGIT

   An example is

       Content-Length: 3495

Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the transfer-length of
   the message-body, unless this is prohibited by the rules in section
   4.4.


Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.
   Section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body
   if a Content-Length is not given.

   Note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from
   the corresponding definition in MIME, where it is an optional field
   used within the "message/external-body" content-type. In HTTP, it
   SHOULD be sent whenever the message's length can be determined prior
   to being transferred, unless this is prohibited by the rules in
   section 4.4.

The `Content-Length` header in HTTP specifies the size of the entity-body, measured in octets (bytes), 
that is being sent in the message to the recipient. 
It's essential for both the client and server to know the size of the content being transferred so they can allocate the necessary resources and manage the transmission effectively.



Here's a breakdown of how the `Content-Length` header works:

1. Syntax: The syntax for the `Content-Length` header is simple: it consists of the header name followed by a colon and the size of the entity-body in decimal digits.


               Content-Length: 3495


2. Usage: This header is typically included in the HTTP response sent by the server to the client. 
      It informs the client about the size of the content being sent. 
      However, it can also be included in HTTP requests, particularly when the client is sending data to the server.

3. Purpose:
   - For Responses: In responses, the `Content-Length` header indicates the size of the entity-body that the server is sending to the client. 
        This helps the client know when the entire response has been received.
   - For Requests: In requests, if the `Content-Length` header is present, it specifies the size of the entity-body being sent by the client to the server. 
        This helps the server know how much data to expect.

4. Importance: The `Content-Length` header is crucial for various aspects of HTTP communication, including:
   - Proper allocation of memory and resources by both client and server.
   - Determining the end of the message body.
   - Ensuring data integrity and preventing buffer overflows or underflows.

5. Handling of Zero or Positive Values: Any value greater than or equal to zero is considered a valid `Content-Length`. 
        A value of zero indicates an empty entity-body. 
      The `Content-Length` value must accurately reflect the number of octets in the entity-body.

Overall, the `Content-Length` header is vital for efficient and reliable communication between clients and servers in the HTTP protocol, ensuring proper 
handling and transmission of entity-bodies.
