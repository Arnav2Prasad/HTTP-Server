                              14.17 Content-Type

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Content-Type entity-header field indicates the media type of the
   entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method,
   the media type that would have been sent had the request been a GET.

Content-Type   = "Content-Type" ":" media-type

   Media types are defined in section 3.7. An example of the field is

       Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4

   Further discussion of methods for identifying the media type of an
   entity is provided in section 7.2.1.

USED BY SERVER ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `Content-Type` header in an HTTP message specifies the media type of the resource being sent to the recipient. 
This header is essential because it informs the recipient (typically a web browser or client) how to interpret 
the data in the entity-body. 

The `Content-Type` header includes the type of the media and sometimes additional parameters such as the character set.


#Syntax

The syntax for the `Content-Type` header is:


      Content-Type: media-type


Where `media-type` is defined by the MIME type and can include additional parameters.


#Media Types

Media types (or MIME types) are defined in section 3.7 of RFC 2616. 
They are composed of a type and a subtype, separated by a slash (`/`). Examples include:

          - `text/html`
          - `image/jpeg`
          - `application/json`

#Example

#HTML Document

If a server sends an HTML document, the `Content-Type` header might look like this:


          Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8


This indicates that the content is HTML text, encoded using the UTF-8 character set.

Example HTTP Response:


            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            Date: Sat, 15 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
            Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
            Content-Length: 1234
            
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
                <title>Example Page</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <p>Hello, world!</p>
            </body>
            </html>


#JSON Response

If a server responds with a JSON object, the `Content-Type` header might be:


          Content-Type: application/json


Example HTTP Response:


            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            Date: Sat, 15 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
            Content-Type: application/json
            Content-Length: 123
            
            {
                "name": "John Doe",
                "age": 30,
                "city": "New York"
            }


#JPEG Image

For an image, the `Content-Type` header would be:


        Content-Type: image/jpeg


Example HTTP Response:


          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
          Date: Sat, 15 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
          Content-Type: image/jpeg
          Content-Length: 98765
          
          [Binary data of the JPEG image]


#HEAD Method

When a `HEAD` request is made, the server responds with headers as if it were a `GET` request, 
but without the body. This includes the `Content-Type` header.

Example HEAD Request:


          HEAD /example.html HTTP/1.1
          Host: example.com


Example HEAD Response:

        
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Date: Sat, 15 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
        Content-Length: 1234


In this case, the server indicates the media type and size of the resource that would be sent if the request were a `GET` request.

#Summary

The `Content-Type` header is crucial for the correct interpretation of the data in the HTTP response. 
It specifies the media type and any additional parameters, such as the character set for text data. 
This allows clients to properly process and display the content received from the server.
