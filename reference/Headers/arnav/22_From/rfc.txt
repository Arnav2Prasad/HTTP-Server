                            14.22 From


optional
-------------------------------------------------

 The From request-header field, if given, SHOULD contain an Internet
   e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user
   agent. The address SHOULD be machine-usable, as defined by "mailbox"
   in RFC 822 [9] as updated by RFC 1123 [8]:

               From   = "From" ":" mailbox
              
                 An example is:
              
                     From: webmaster@w3.org


  This header field MAY be used for logging purposes and as a means for
   identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests. It SHOULD NOT
   be used as an insecure form of access protection. The interpretation
   of this field is that the request is being performed on behalf of the
   person given, who accepts responsibility for the method performed. In
   particular, robot agents SHOULD include this header so that the
   person responsible for running the robot can be contacted if problems
   occur on the receiving end.

The Internet e-mail address in this field MAY be separate from the
   Internet host which issued the request. For example, when a request
   is passed through a proxy the original issuer's address SHOULD be
   used.


The client SHOULD NOT send the From header field without the user's
   approval, as it might conflict with the user's privacy interests or
   their site's security policy. It is strongly recommended that the
   user be able to disable, enable, and modify the value of this field
   at any time prior to a request.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `From` header in HTTP, as specified in RFC 2616 (now obsolete and replaced by RFC 7231), is used to 
indicate the email address of the user making the request. 
This header allows the client to provide contact information to the server, which can be useful for administrative purposes, 
logging, or tracing request origins.


#Syntax
The `From` header follows this syntax:

              From: <email-address>

Where `<email-address>` is the email address of the user controlling the requesting user agent.

#Example

            From: user@example.com


#Usage
1. Identification: The `From` header allows servers to identify the user making the request. 
      This can be useful for contacting the user in case of issues with the request or for administrative purposes.
2. Optional Header: The use of the `From` header is optional, and many user agents do not include it in their requests by default.
3. Privacy Considerations: Including the `From` header can have privacy implications, 
      as it reveals the user's email address. Therefore, it should be used with caution and typically only in scenarios where 
      such identification is necessary and expected.


#Behavior and Interpretation
- The presence of the `From` header indicates that the user agent is providing a contact email address.
- Servers receiving this header can log the email address or use it for contacting the user if needed.
- It is generally used in automated or programmatic contexts rather than typical web browsing scenarios.


#Example Request
Here is an example of an HTTP request including the `From` header:

              GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
              Host: www.example.com
              From: user@example.com
              User-Agent: CustomUserAgent/1.0
              Accept: text/html


In this example:
- The `From` header specifies that the request is being made by a user whose email address is `user@example.com`.
- This information might be logged by the server for tracking or administrative purposes.

#Summary
The `From` header in HTTP, as defined by RFC 2616, allows the client to include an email address for the user making the request. 
While it can be useful for identifying and contacting the user, it is optional and should be used carefully due to privacy concerns. 
The typical use case for the `From` header is in contexts where user identification is necessary, rather than in standard web browsing.
