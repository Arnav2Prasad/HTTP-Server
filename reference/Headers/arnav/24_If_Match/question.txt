QUESTION : IF ETAG DOESNT MATCHES THE SERVE SHOULD SEND THE LATEST RESPONSE NOT ERROR?WHY IS IT DOING SO IN CONTEXT TO IF-MATCH HTTP RFC

ANSWER:
In the context of the HTTP protocol, the behavior you're referring to involves conditional requests using the `If-Match` header, 
which is defined in RFC 7232. 
To understand why a server might send an error response when an `ETag` (Entity Tag) does not match, 
it's essential to grasp the purpose and mechanics of the `If-Match` header.

#Purpose of `If-Match`

The `If-Match` header is used to make a request conditional. 
Specifically, it is used to ensure that the request method is applied only if the entity (resource) 
matches one of the listed `ETag` values. 
This mechanism helps in preventing unintentional updates to a resource, 
which is crucial for maintaining data integrity in scenarios involving concurrent modifications.


#Mechanism

When a client sends a request with an `If-Match` header, it includes one or more `ETag` values. 
The server then compares these `ETag` values with the current `ETag` of the resource. Depending on the result of this 
comparison, the server responds in the following ways:

1. If the `ETag` matches: The server processes the request as usual. For example, if it's a `PUT` request, the server updates the resource.
2. If the `ETag` does not match: The server must not perform the requested method. Instead, it responds with a `412 Precondition Failed`
    status code.


# Reason for `412 Precondition Failed`

The rationale behind responding with a `412 Precondition Failed` error rather than serving the latest version of the resource 
is to prevent unintended overwrites and to signal to the client that the precondition specified by `If-Match` was not met. 

This is critical in the following scenarios:

- Concurrent Updates: Multiple clients might be attempting to update the same resource. 
    If the server always served the latest response when `ETag` values did not match, it would override the conditional request mechanism. 
      This could lead to lost updates and data inconsistency.
- Optimistic Concurrency Control: The `If-Match` header facilitates optimistic concurrency control. 
    Clients can fetch the latest `ETag`, modify the resource, and then attempt to update it only if the resource has not 
    been changed by another client in the meantime. If the `ETag` does not match, it indicates that the resource has been 
    modified since the client last fetched it, and the client can then decide how to handle this situation 
      (e.g., by retrying the fetch-update cycle).



#Example Scenario

Consider the following sequence:

1. Client A fetches resource `/example` with `ETag` `W/"123"`.
2. Client B fetches the same resource with `ETag` `W/"123"`.
3. Client A modifies the resource and sends a `PUT` request with `If-Match: W/"123"`. The server processes this request, 
    updates the resource, and assigns a new `ETag`, say `W/"456"`.
4. Client B, unaware of Client A's update, attempts to modify the resource and sends a `PUT` request with `If-Match: W/"123"`.

In this scenario, if the server allowed the update from Client B without checking the `ETag`, 
it would overwrite the changes made by Client A, leading to data inconsistency. 
By responding with `412 Precondition Failed`, the server informs Client B that the resource has changed 
since it was last fetched, prompting Client B to fetch the latest version before attempting further modifications.

#Conclusion

The `If-Match` header's primary role is to ensure safe and consistent updates to resources by preventing unintended modifications. 
When an `ETag` does not match, the server correctly responds with a `412 Precondition Failed` status to uphold this mechanism, 
ensuring that clients are aware of the current state of the resource before making changes. This behavior is intentional and 
specified in the HTTP standard to maintain data integrity and support concurrent operations effectively.
