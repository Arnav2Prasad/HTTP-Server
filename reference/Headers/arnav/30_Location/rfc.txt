                                14.30 Location
It is typically used in response to a request to indicate that the resource has moved to a different location or to 
suggest a new location for the requested resource.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient
   to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the
   request or identification of a new resource. For 201 (Created)
   responses, the Location is that of the new resource which was created
   by the request. For 3xx responses, the location SHOULD indicate the
   server's preferred URI for automatic redirection to the resource. The
   field value consists of a single absolute URI.

       Location       = "Location" ":" absoluteURI

   An example is:

       Location: http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/People.html

Note: The Content-Location header field (section 14.14) differs
      from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the original
      location of the entity enclosed in the request. It is therefore
      possible for a response to contain header fields for both Location
      and Content-Location. Also see section 13.10 for cache
      requirements of some methods.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The `Location` header in HTTP, as specified in RFC 2616 (which has been superseded by RFC 7231), 
is used to redirect the recipient to a different URL. 
It is typically used in response to a request to indicate that the resource has moved to a different location or to 
suggest a new location for the requested resource.

#Syntax
The `Location` header follows this syntax:

          Location: <absolute-URI>

Where `<absolute-URI>` is the new URL where the client should be redirected.

#Example

          Location: http://www.example.com/newpage.html


#Usage
1. Redirection: The `Location` header is primarily used to perform URL redirections. 
        It informs the client that it should make a new request to the URL specified in the `Location` header.
2. Status Codes: The `Location` header is used in conjunction with specific HTTP status codes that indicate redirection. 
      Common status codes include:
   - `301 Moved Permanently`: The resource has been permanently moved to the new URL.
   - `302 Found` (formerly "Moved Temporarily"): The resource is temporarily located at the new URL.
   - `303 See Other`: The response to the request can be found at another URI using a GET method.
   - `307 Temporary Redirect`: The resource is temporarily located at the new URL and should be accessed using the same method.
   - `308 Permanent Redirect`: The resource has been permanently moved to the new URL and should be accessed using the same method.


#Example Response
Here is an example of an HTTP response that uses the `Location` header to perform a redirection:

            HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
            Location: http://www.example.com/newpage.html
            Content-Type: text/html
            
            <html>
            <body>
              <h1>Moved Permanently</h1>
              <p>The document has moved <a href="http://www.example.com/newpage.html">here</a>.</p>
            </body>
            </html>


In this example:
- The server responds with a `301 Moved Permanently` status code.
- The `Location` header specifies the new URL `http://www.example.com/newpage.html`.
- The client is expected to make a new request to the URL provided in the `Location` header.

#Practical Use Cases
1. Resource Relocation: When a resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, the server uses the `301 Moved Permanently` 
      status code along with the `Location` header to inform clients of the new location.
2. Load Balancing: Servers might use the `Location` header to redirect clients to different servers or resources for 
      load balancing purposes.
3. URL Shortening Services: URL shortening services use the `Location` header to redirect short URLs to the original long URLs.
4. Form Submission: After processing a form, a server might redirect the client to a different page (e.g., a confirmation page) 
      using the `303 See Other` status code.

#Summary
The `Location` header in HTTP, as defined by RFC 2616, is used to inform clients of a new URL for a requested resource, 
typically in the context of redirection. It works in conjunction with specific status codes to indicate the nature of the 
redirection, whether it is permanent, temporary, or requires a different method for accessing the new location. 
The `Location` header is a key component in managing resource URLs and guiding client navigation.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Certainly! Here are specific examples of HTTP responses using the `Location` header with different status codes to 
demonstrate various types of redirection.

#Example 1: Permanent Redirection (`301 Moved Permanently`)
This response indicates that the resource has been moved permanently to a new URL. 
Clients should update their bookmarks to the new URL.


            HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
            Location: http://www.example.com/newpage.html
            Content-Type: text/html
            
            <html>
              <head>
                <title>301 Moved Permanently</title>
              </head>
              <body>
                <h1>Moved Permanently</h1>
                <p>The document has moved to <a href="http://www.example.com/newpage.html">this new location</a>.</p>
              </body>
            </html>


#Example 2: Temporary Redirection (`302 Found`)
This response indicates that the resource is temporarily available at a different URL. 
Clients should continue to use the original URL for future requests.

        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: http://www.example.com/temporarypage.html
        Content-Type: text/html
        
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>302 Found</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>Found</h1>
            <p>The document is temporarily available at <a href="http://www.example.com/temporarypage.html">this location</a>.</p>
          </body>
        </html>



#Example 3: See Other (`303 See Other`)
This response is used to redirect the client to a different resource, 
typically after a POST request, with the new resource accessible via a GET request.

            HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
            Location: http://www.example.com/confirmation.html
            Content-Type: text/html
            
            <html>
              <head>
                <title>303 See Other</title>
              </head>
              <body>
                <h1>See Other</h1>
                <p>The result of the POST request can be found at <a href="http://www.example.com/confirmation.html">this location</a>.</p>
              </body>
            </html>


#Example 4: Temporary Redirect (`307 Temporary Redirect`)
This response indicates that the resource is temporarily available at a different URL, and the 
client should use the same HTTP method for the subsequent request.


        HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect
        Location: http://www.example.com/temporarypage.html
        Content-Type: text/html
        
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>307 Temporary Redirect</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>Temporary Redirect</h1>
            <p>The document is temporarily available at <a href="http://www.example.com/temporarypage.html">this location</a>.</p>
          </body>
        </html>


#Example 5: Permanent Redirect (`308 Permanent Redirect`)
This response indicates that the resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, and the client should use the 
same HTTP method for future requests.


          HTTP/1.1 308 Permanent Redirect
          Location: http://www.example.com/newpage.html
          Content-Type: text/html
          
          <html>
            <head>
              <title>308 Permanent Redirect</title>
            </head>
            <body>
              <h1>Permanent Redirect</h1>
              <p>The document has permanently moved to <a href="http://www.example.com/newpage.html">this location</a>.</p>
            </body>
          </html>


#Summary
These examples show how the `Location` header is used in different types of HTTP responses to redirect clients to a new URL. 
Each status code communicates the nature of the redirection, whether it is permanent, temporary, or specific to a 
particular request method.
