                        14.31 Max-Forwards

The Max-Forwards request-header field provides a mechanism with the
   TRACE (section 9.8) and OPTIONS (section 9.2) methods to limit the
   number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the
   next inbound server. This can be useful when the client is attempting
   to trace a request chain which appears to be failing or looping in
   mid-chain.

Max-Forwards   = "Max-Forwards" ":" 1*DIGIT

   The Max-Forwards value is a decimal integer indicating the remaining
   number of times this request message may be forwarded.

Each proxy or gateway recipient of a TRACE or OPTIONS request
   containing a Max-Forwards header field MUST check and update its
   value prior to forwarding the request. If the received value is zero
   (0), the recipient MUST NOT forward the request; instead, it MUST
   respond as the final recipient. If the received Max-Forwards value is
   greater than zero, then the forwarded message MUST contain an updated
   Max-Forwards field with a value decremented by one (1).

The Max-Forwards header field MAY be ignored for all other methods
   defined by this specification and for any extension methods for which
   it is not explicitly referred to as part of that method definition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `Max-Forwards` header field in HTTP is used to limit the number of times a request can be forwarded by proxies or gateways. 
This header field is particularly relevant for the TRACE and OPTIONS methods, which are often used for diagnostic purposes. 

#Purpose of `Max-Forwards`

1. Limiting Forwarding:
   - The `Max-Forwards` header is used to control the number of times a request can be forwarded through 
      proxies or gateways before it reaches the final destination server. This helps prevent infinite loops in proxy 
      configurations and controls the propagation of requests.

2. Diagnostic Tools:
   - The TRACE and OPTIONS methods can benefit from `Max-Forwards` as they are used for diagnostics. 
    By controlling the number of forwards, these methods can help trace the path a request takes or determine the capabilities of 
      intermediate servers without overwhelming the network.


#How `Max-Forwards` Works

- Initial Value:
  - When a client sends a request, it includes the `Max-Forwards` header with a specific integer value 
      indicating the maximum number of forwards allowed.
  
- Decrementing:
  - Each proxy or gateway that forwards the request decrements the `Max-Forwards` value by one. 
      If the value reaches zero, the request is not forwarded further and is processed by the current server.

- Handling Zero:
  - When a server receives a request with `Max-Forwards` set to zero, it processes the request without forwarding it. 
    For example, in the case of a TRACE request, the server will respond with the request message it received.



#Examples

#Example 1: Using TRACE with `Max-Forwards`

A client wants to trace the route to the server, ensuring the request is not forwarded more than 5 times:

Client’s TRACE Request:

          TRACE / HTTP/1.1
          Host: example.com
          Max-Forwards: 5


Behavior:
- Each proxy or gateway that forwards this request will decrement the `Max-Forwards` value by one.
- If the value of `Max-Forwards` reaches zero, the server that receives the request will respond with a 200 OK status and 
      include the received request message in the body.

Response When `Max-Forwards` Reaches Zero:

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: message/http
        
        TRACE / HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com
        Max-Forwards: 0


#Example 2: Using OPTIONS with `Max-Forwards`

A client wants to determine the supported methods on the path to a server, ensuring the request is not forwarded more than 10 times:

Client’s OPTIONS Request:
        
        OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
        Host: example.com
        Max-Forwards: 10


Behavior:
- Each proxy or gateway that forwards this request will decrement the `Max-Forwards` value by one.
- When the value reaches zero, the server processes the request locally and responds with the supported methods.

Response When `Max-Forwards` Reaches Zero:

            HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST


#Summary

- Header Definition:
  - `Max-Forwards` is a request header used to limit the number of times a request can be forwarded by proxies or gateways.
  
- Initial Value and Decrementing:
  - The client sets the initial value. Each forwarding server decrements this value by one until it reaches zero.
  
- Handling Zero:
  - When `Max-Forwards` is zero, the request is processed by the current server without being forwarded further.

- Use Cases:
  - Useful for TRACE and OPTIONS methods to trace the path and determine capabilities of servers without excessive forwarding.

The `Max-Forwards` header helps manage and diagnose network paths, ensuring that requests do not loop indefinitely and providing 
control over the propagation of diagnostic requests.
