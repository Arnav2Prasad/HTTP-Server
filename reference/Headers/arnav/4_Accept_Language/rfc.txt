                14.4 Accept-Language

The Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but
   restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a
   response to the request. Language tags are defined in section 3.10.



--->>>   White space is not allowed within the tag and all tags are case-
   insensitive. The name space of language tags is administered by the
   IANA. Example tags include:


 Each language-range MAY be given an associated quality value which
   represents an estimate of the users preference for the languages
   specified by that range. The quality value defaults to "q=1". For
   example,

       Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7

   would mean: "I prefer Danish, but will accept British English and
   other types of English."

A language-range matches a language-tag if
   it exactly equals the tag, or if it exactly equals a prefix of the
   tag such that the first tag character following the prefix is "-".
   The special range "*", if present in the Accept-Language field,
   matches every tag not matched by any other range present in the
   Accept-Language field.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This note addresses how prefix matching works with language tags in the context of HTTP headers, 
particularly `Accept-Language`. The `Accept-Language` header is used by HTTP clients to specify the preferred 
languages for the response.

#Language Tags and Prefix Matching

Language tags follow a specific format defined by BCP 47 (e.g., `en`, `en-US`, `fr`, `fr-CA`). 
  Prefix matching in this context means that a more general language tag can match a more specific one.

#Prefix Matching Rule
Prefix matching allows a language tag to match more specific tags that begin with the same sequence. 
    For example, `en` (English) can match `en-US` (American English) and `en-GB` (British English).

#Important Clarification

The note clarifies that using a prefix matching rule does not necessarily mean that understanding a language with a certain 
tag implies understanding all languages with tags for which this tag is a prefix. This means:

- Example: If a user understands `en` (general English), it does not automatically mean they understand `en-US` (American English) 
      or `en-GB` (British English).
- Purpose of Prefix Rule: The prefix rule is there to provide flexibility and to allow matching based on prefixes if 
        it makes sense, not to enforce a strict understanding relationship between languages and their more specific forms.

#Why This Clarification is Important

1. Real-World Scenarios*: Language understanding is complex. 
      Just because someone understands a general language doesnt mean they understand all its dialects or regional variants.
   - Example: A person fluent in British English (`en-GB`) may not understand all nuances of American English (`en-US`), even 
        though `en-GB` and `en-US` share the `en` prefix.

2. Implementation Flexibility: The prefix rule provides a way to use more general tags to match more specific ones 
      if the client's language preferences are broad.
   - Example: If a client prefers `fr` (French), they may accept content in `fr-CA` (Canadian French) or `fr-FR` 
        (French as spoken in France), but this should not be assumed without further context.

#Practical Implications

When a server receives an `Accept-Language` header:

- Matching Logic: It can use prefix matching to find a suitable response language.
  - Example: A client with `Accept-Language: en` could receive content in `en-US` if no `en` content is available, 
        but the server should not assume complete understanding.
- Client Preferences: Clients can list specific language preferences to ensure they receive content in the exact variant they prefer.
  - Example: `Accept-Language: en-GB, en;q=0.8` shows a preference for British English with a fallback to general English.

#Summary

The note emphasizes that while prefix matching is a useful tool for language negotiation in HTTP, 
it does not imply that users who understand a general language tag will understand all its specific variants. 
The rule allows for flexible use of language tags but should be applied with the understanding that linguistic comprehension 
is nuanced and not strictly hierarchical based on tags.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The language quality factor assigned to a language-tag by the
   Accept-Language field is the quality value of the longest language-
   range in the field that matches the language-tag. 

If no language-
   range in the field matches the tag, the language quality factor
   assigned is 0. If no Accept-Language header is present in the
   request, the server SHOULD assume that all languages are equally acceptable. If an
   Accept-Language header is present, then all languages which are
   assigned a quality factor greater than 0 are acceptable.


It might be contrary to the privacy expectations of the user to send
   an Accept-Language header with the complete linguistic preferences of
   the user in every request. For a discussion of this issue, see
   section 15.1.4.

   As intelligibility is highly dependent on the individual user, it is
   recommended that client applications make the choice of linguistic
   preference available to the user. If the choice is not made
   available, then the Accept-Language header field MUST NOT be given in
   the request.





Note: When making the choice of linguistic preference available to
      the user, we remind implementors of  the fact that users are not
      familiar with the details of language matching as described above,
      and should provide appropriate guidance. As an example, users
      might assume that on selecting "en-gb", they will be served any
      kind of English document if British English is not available. A
      user agent might suggest in such a case to add "en" to get the
      best matching behavior.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example Scenario

    User Selection: A user selects "en-gb" (British English) as their preferred language.
    User Assumption: The user might assume that if British English content is not available, any kind of English 
          content (like American English) will be provided.
    Reality: Without further configuration, selecting only "en-gb" might lead to a situation where no English content 
          is served if specifically British English content is unavailable.

Suggested Solution

    Adding "en" for Broader Matching:
        A user agent (such as a web browser) could suggest or automatically add the general "en" tag in addition to "en-gb".
        This means the Accept-Language header would include both "en-gb" and "en".
        Result: If British English is not available, any other English variant can be served.


Practical Implementation
User Agent Behavior

    User Interface:
        When a user selects "en-gb" as their preferred language, the user agent might display a message or provide an option:
            "To ensure you receive English content even if British English is unavailable, consider adding 'en' as a fallback."

    Automatic Addition:
        Alternatively, the user agent might automatically add "en" without requiring user intervention:
            If "en-gb" is selected, the Accept-Language header could be set to: Accept-Language: en-gb, en;q=0.8
            This ensures a broader matching range while still prioritizing British English.


The note advises implementors to assist users in setting their linguistic preferences by providing appropriate guidance. 
Users might not understand the intricacies of language tags and matching, so suggesting the addition of broader language 
tags (like "en" alongside "en-gb") ensures better matching behavior and improves the user experience. 
This proactive approach helps users receive content in a language they understand, even if their specific variant is not available.
