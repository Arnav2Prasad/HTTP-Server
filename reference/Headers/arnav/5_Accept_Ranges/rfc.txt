            14.5 Accept-Ranges

        < SERVER >

 The Accept-Ranges response-header field allows the server to
      indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource:

          Accept-Ranges     = "Accept-Ranges" ":" acceptable-ranges
          acceptable-ranges = 1#range-unit | "none"

      Origin servers that accept byte-range requests MAY send

          Accept-Ranges: bytes

      but are not required to do so. Clients MAY generate byte-range
      requests without having received this header for the resource
      involved. Range units are defined in section 3.12.

      Servers that do not accept any kind of range request for a
      resource MAY send

          Accept-Ranges: none

      to advise the client not to attempt a range request.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `Accept-Ranges` response header field in HTTP is used by servers to inform clients whether they support range requests 
for a particular resource.

#`Accept-Ranges` Header Field

#Definition and Syntax


        Accept-Ranges     = "Accept-Ranges" ":" acceptable-ranges
        acceptable-ranges = 1#range-unit | "none"


- `Accept-Ranges`: The header field name.
- `acceptable-ranges`: This can either be one or more range units (e.g., `bytes`) or the value `none`.

#Range Units

- `1#range-unit`: This means one or more range units, such as `bytes`. Range units are defined types of ranges 
        that can be requested. In HTTP, the most common range unit is `bytes`.
- `none`: This value indicates that the server does not support any kind of range requests for the resource.



#Purpose and Usage

#Indicating Support for Range Requests

- `Accept-Ranges: bytes`: When a server sends this header, it indicates that it supports byte-range requests. 
      Byte-range requests allow a client to request a specific portion (range) of a resource, which is particularly useful 
      for large files where a client may need only a part of the file, such as when resuming interrupted downloads or streaming media.

#Optional Nature

- Optional Header: Origin servers that support byte-range requests may include this header in their responses but are not 
      required to do so. Even without this header, clients are still allowed to make byte-range requests.



#Clients and Byte-Range Requests

- Client Behavior: Clients may generate byte-range requests even if they havenâ€™t received an `Accept-Ranges` 
    header indicating support. The absence of this header does not mean byte-range requests are unsupported; 
    it simply means the server did not advertise its capability.

            < ADVERTISE >




#Indicating Lack of Support

- `Accept-Ranges: none`: When a server sends this header, it informs the client that it does not support any range requests 
      for the resource. This advises the client not to attempt any range requests for this resource, as they will not be honored.

#Examples

#Example 1: Server Supports Byte Ranges

If a server supports byte-range requests, it might send:

                Accept-Ranges: bytes


This informs the client that it can request specific byte ranges of the resource.



#Example 2: Server Does Not Support Range Requests

If a server does not support any range requests, it might send:


              Accept-Ranges: none


This tells the client that any attempt to request a range of the resource will be futile.

#Range Units in Section 3.12

- Range Units: These are defined in section 3.12 of the HTTP specification. T
      The most commonly used range unit is `bytes`, but other range units may also be defined and used in specific contexts.

#Practical Implications

- Efficient Resource Usage: Range requests enable clients to efficiently retrieve parts of a large resource, 
            which is useful for large downloads, streaming, or resuming interrupted downloads.
- Server Communication: By using the `Accept-Ranges` header, servers can communicate their capabilities and limitations 
        regarding range requests, guiding client behavior and optimizing interactions.

#Summary

The `Accept-Ranges` header is a mechanism for servers to inform clients about their support for range requests.
  Servers that support byte-range requests may include `Accept-Ranges: bytes`, while those that do not support any range requests 
  may use `Accept-Ranges: none`. 
This helps clients understand how they can interact with the server regarding partial content retrieval.
