The Age response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the
      amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was
      generated at the origin server.


A cached response is "fresh" if
      its age does not exceed its freshness lifetime. Age values are
      calculated as specified in section 13.2.3.


Age values are non-negative decimal integers, representing time in
      seconds.


If a cache receives a value larger than the largest positive
      integer it can represent, or if any of its age calculations
      overflows, it MUST transmit an Age header with a value of
      2147483648 (2^31). 


An HTTP/1.1 server that includes a cache MUST
      include an Age header field in every response generated from its
      own cache. Caches SHOULD use an arithmetic type of at least 31
      bits of range.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The `Age` header in HTTP is used to communicate the approximate age of a cached response in seconds since it 
was generated or revalidated at the origin server. 

#Definition of `Age` Header

The `Age` header field is defined as follows:

            
            Age = "Age" ":" age-value
            age-value = delta-seconds


- `age-value`: This is a non-negative decimal integer representing the age of the response in seconds.

#Purpose of `Age` Header

The `Age` header serves several purposes in HTTP caching:

1. Cache Freshness: It helps determine if a cached response is still fresh and can be used to satisfy subsequent requests 
          without revalidation.
   
2. Cache Revalidation: It assists caches in understanding how long ago the response was generated or revalidated at the origin server.



#Calculating `Age` Values

- Delta-seconds: This represents the time elapsed since the response was generated or revalidated. 
    It is typically calculated by the cache based on the current time minus the time specified in the `Date` header of the response.



#Handling Large Values

The HTTP/1.1 specification provides guidance on how caches should handle large values for `Age`:

- Overflow Condition: If a cache receives a value larger than the largest positive integer it can represent or if 
      any of its age calculations cause an overflow, it must transmit an `Age` header with a value of `2147483648` (2^31).
  
- Reasoning: This large value serves as an indicator that an overflow condition occurred during age calculation or 
        that the age exceeds the capacity of the cache's representation for integer values.




#Requirements for Servers and Caches

- HTTP/1.1 Servers with Caches: Servers that include a cache must include an `Age` header field in every 
        response generated from their cache. This ensures that downstream caches and clients can properly understand the 
        freshness and validity of cached responses.

- Arithmetic Type: Caches are recommended to use an arithmetic type that supports at least 31 bits of range to handle `Age` 
        values properly, especially to avoid overflow errors.

#Practical Implications

- Cache Communication: The `Age` header is crucial for caches to communicate the freshness of cached responses accurately.
  
- Handling Large Values: Caches encountering large values or overflow conditions must handle them gracefully by
        transmitting the specified `2147483648` value in the `Age` header.



#Summary

The `Age` header in HTTP is essential for caching mechanisms to manage and communicate the age of cached responses. 
It ensures that caches can effectively determine if a response is fresh enough to serve without revalidation. 
The specification's provisions regarding large values and overflow conditions help maintain consistency and reliability 
in caching behavior across different implementations.
