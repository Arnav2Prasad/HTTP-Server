STATUS CODE : 406 (NOT ACCEPTABLE)

The Accept-Charset request-header field can be used to indicate what
   character sets are acceptable for the response. This field allows
   clients capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-
   purpose character sets to signal that capability to a server which is
   capable of representing documents in those character sets.
-------------------------------------------------------------

The `Accept-Charset` header in HTTP is used by clients to specify the character sets (encodings) they prefer for the server 
to use when responding to a request.

#`Accept-Charset` Header Syntax and Example

The `Accept-Charset` header allows clients to list preferred character sets and assign them quality values (`q` values) to indicate 
preference strength. Hereâ€™s the example given:


Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8


#Breakdown of the Example

- `iso-8859-5`: This character set is specified without a `q` value, which means it defaults to the highest preference (`q=1`).
- `unicode-1-1;q=0.8`: This character set is specified with a `q` value of 0.8, indicating a lower preference compared to `iso-8859-5`.

#Quality Values (`q` Values)

- `q` value: A decimal value between 0 and 1 indicating the client's preference for that charset. 
        Higher values indicate higher preference.
- Default `q` value: If a charset is listed without a `q` value, it defaults to `q=1`.

#Special Value `*`

- `*` (wildcard): If included in the `Accept-Charset` field, 
          it matches any character set not explicitly mentioned elsewhere in the header. 
        It effectively acts as a fallback for unspecified charsets.
  
  - Example: `Accept-Charset: *, utf-8;q=0.5`
    - This means any charset is acceptable, but `utf-8` is less preferred (with `q=0.5`).

#Default Handling of Unmentioned Charsets

- With `*` present: All character sets not explicitly mentioned are matched by the `*` and given its `q` value.
- Without `*` present:
  - Unmentioned charsets: All charsets not explicitly listed are assigned a `q` value of 0, meaning they are not acceptable.
  - Exception for ISO-8859-1: This charset is treated specially. 
    If `ISO-8859-1` is not mentioned and `*` is not present, it gets a `q` value of 1, making it fully acceptable by default.

#Practical Implications

1. highest Preference: Charsets explicitly mentioned with high `q` values or no `q` values (defaulting to `q=1`).
2. Fallback Preference: If `*` is included, it serves as a catch-all for any unspecified charsets.
3. Default Rejection: Without `*`, unspecified charsets are generally rejected (`q=0`), 
          except for `ISO-8859-1`, which is accepted (`q=1`).

#Example Scenarios

#example 1: Explicit Preferences Without Wildcard

              
              Accept-Charset: utf-8, iso-8859-5;q=0.8
              

- utf-8: Preferred (q=1).
- iso-8859-5: Less preferred (q=0.8).
- Other charsets: Not acceptable (q=0), except ISO-8859-1 which defaults to q=1.

#Example 2: Explicit Preferences with Wildcard


                  Accept-Charset: utf-8;q=0.5, *
                  

- utf-8: Less preferred (q=0.5).
- Other charsets: Acceptable (q=1), since `*` covers all unspecified charsets.

#Summary

The `Accept-Charset` header allows HTTP clients to specify their preferred character sets and assign relative preferences using `q` values. 
The special handling of `*` and `ISO-8859-1` ensures flexibility and backwards compatibility, respectively, providing a robust way to 
manage character set preferences in HTTP communication.


-----------------------------------------------------

If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any
   character set is acceptable. If an Accept-Charset header is present,
   and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable
   according to the Accept-Charset header, then the server SHOULD send
   an error response with the 406 (not acceptable) status code, though
   the sending of an unacceptable response is also allowed.
