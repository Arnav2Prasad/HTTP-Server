Proxies serve as intermediaries between your computer and the internet, providing anonymity, security, and the ability to 
circumvent geographical or institutional blocks. 
For developers, particularly those working with Python, proxies can be crucial tools. 

This article explores how to effectively utilize proxies in Python and where to purchase them.

Understanding Proxies

What are Proxies?
A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s primarily used to enhance privacy and filter web traffic.


Different Types of Proxies
Proxies come in various forms such as HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, residential, and data center proxies, each serving different purposes.


Setting Up Your Python Environment
To begin using proxies in Python, you’ll need to set up your environment with the right tools. 
This involves installing Python and pip, followed by proxy-handling libraries like requests, scrapy, or selenium.


How to Use Proxies with the requests Library

Configuring proxies Here’s how you can use proxies with Python’s requests library:

                # Import the requests library which allows you to send HTTP requests using Python
                import requests
                
                # Define a dictionary to hold proxy settings for HTTP and HTTPS protocols
                proxies = {
                    'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',  # Proxy for handling HTTP requests
                    'https': 'https://10.10.1.10:1080' # Proxy for handling HTTPS requests
                }
                
                # Send a GET request to 'http://example.com' using the defined proxies
                response = requests.get('http://example.com', proxies=proxies)
                
                # Print the text content of the response received from the server
                print(response.text)

Handling proxy authentication For proxies that require authentication, modify your proxies dictionary to include your credentials.
