What is a Proxy Server ?
A proxy server connects your device to the internet

Your request is sent to the proxy server first when you make a request for information from a website.

The proxy server then sends your request to the target website, which then retrieves the data on your behalf and sends it back to your device.

This process improves privacy and security by effectively hiding your IP address and location from the targeted website.

Title: How Proxy Servers Work: A Comprehensive Guide

Introduction

In the digital age, where privacy and security are paramount, proxy servers have become indispensable tools for 
individuals and organizations alike. Whether you’re looking to protect your online identity, access geo-restricted content, 
or enhance your cybersecurity, understanding how proxy servers work is essential. 

This comprehensive guide will walk you through the ins and outs of proxies, shedding light on their mechanisms, types, and 
various applications.


What is a Proxy Server?

A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. 
When you request information from a website, your request is sent to the proxy server first. 
The proxy server then forwards your request to the target website, retrieves the data on your behalf, and sends 
it back to your device. This process effectively masks your IP address and location from the target website, 
providing anonymity and security benefits.


How Do Proxy Servers Work?

    1. Request Forwarding: Your internet traffic gets routed through a proxy server when you connect to one. 
          A request that you make, such as to open a website or download a file, is sent to the proxy server first.
    2. Proxy Server Processes the Request: Your request is handled by the proxy server. 
        The proxy server sends the requested data back to you.
    3. Forwarding to the Target Server: The proxy server forwards your request to the target server, such as a website’s 
        hosting server or a content server.
    4. Target Server Responds: The target server responds to the request as it normally would, but instead of 
        sending it directly to your device, it sends it to the proxy server.
    5. Response to Your Device: You receive the requested data after the proxy server forwards the target server’s 
        response back to your device.

It’s important to note that the website only sees the IP address of the proxy server and not the IP address of your device.
