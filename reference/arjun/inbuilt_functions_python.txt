# this file contains some of the inbuilt python libraries that we might need
# I am adding the names here as I encounter them

# 1. urlparse
# with these routines, you can get large and complex URLs
# and turn them into their component parts, 
# with RFC-compliant parsing already implemented for you
# this contains functions that can parse URLs and identify their components

from urlparse import urlparse, urldefrag, parse_qs, parse_qsl

#2. urllib2
# this is for study purposes, not directly useful in the project
# should check out its docs tho, I haven't gone through them yet
import urllib2
