Question : 
        (a) I HAVE A CONCEPTUAL DOUDBT : A SERVER IS LISTENING TO A CONNECTION AT A DEFAULT PORT THAT ALL KNOWS FOR EXAMPLE FOR TCP ITS 80 , 
        NOW AS SOON AS A CLIENT WANTS TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION TO THE SERVER , IT WILL SEND THE REQUEST AT THAT CERTAIN PORT , 
        ONCE THE CONNECTIN IS ESTABLISHED WILL IT COMMUNICATE STILL WITH THE DEFAULT SERVER PORT OR THE SERVER WILL CREATE A 
        NEW PORT FOR THE SPECIFIC SERVER FOR COMMUNICATION

        (b) But the output of code is Listening at ('127.0.0.1', 1060)
        We have accepted a connection from ('127.0.0.1', 58900)
        Socket connects ('127.0.0.1', 1060) and ('127.0.0.1', 58900)
        IT SAYS Socket connects ('127.0.0.1', 1060) and ('127.0.0.1', 58900) AND SERVER'S DEFAULT PORT IS 1060??

ANSWER : 
(a) the initial connection request is sent to the server's well-known port (e.g., port 80). 
Once the server accepts the connection, communication between the server and the client occurs on a new port, 
allowing the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously while keeping the well-known port available for new incoming connections.

-----------------------------------------------
(b)
Yes, you are correct that in the output you provided, the server's default port is 1060, and the client's dynamically assigned 
port is 58900. This output is consistent with the behavior of a TCP server handling incoming connections. Let's clarify the situation:

    Server Listening on a Default Port:
        The server is set up to listen on a specific port, which in this case is 1060. 
        This is the well-known port for this server instance, though it is not a standard port like 80 for 
        HTTP; it's just the port the server was configured to use.
        

    Client Initiates Connection:
        A client initiates a connection to the server's IP address and port 1060. The client's operating 
        system assigns it a local port (58900 in this case) for the outbound connection.

    Connection Details:
        When the connection is established, the server continues to use its listening port (1060) to 
        manage the connection, while the client uses its dynamically assigned port (58900).
        

The serverâ€™s output showing the socket connection details ('127.0.0.1', 1060) and ('127.0.0.1', 58900) indicates that:

    The server is listening and has accepted a connection on port 1060.
    The client's side of the connection is using port 58900.

The server does not switch to a new port for communication in this particular example. 
This can be common in simple server implementations where the same port is used for both listening and communicating. 
More complex server implementations, especially those designed to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently, 
might use different approaches such as forking a new process or spawning a new thread, 
which internally might involve different sockets.
