Detailed Explanation

elif len(sys.argv) == 3 and sys.argv[1] == 'client' and sys.argv[2].isdigit():

- `elif len(sys.argv) == 3`: This checks if there are exactly three command-line arguments. `sys.argv` is a list in Python, 
      which contains the command-line arguments passed to the script.
  - Example: If the script is called as `python tcp_deadlock.py client 32`, then `sys.argv` would be `['tcp_deadlock.py', 'client', '32']`.

- `sys.argv[1] == 'client'`: This checks if the second argument (index 1) is the string `'client'`.
- `sys.argv[2].isdigit()`: This checks if the third argument (index 2) is a string of digits, which means it represents a valid integer.


    bytes = (int(sys.argv[2]) + 15) // 16 * 16  # Round up to nearest multiple of 16

- `int(sys.argv[2])`: Converts the third argument to an integer.

- `(int(sys.argv[2]) + 15) // 16 * 16`: This rounds up the integer to the nearest multiple of 16. The formula works as follows:
  - Add 15 to the integer and perform integer division by 16 (`// 16`). This gives the number of full 16-byte chunks plus possibly a 
      part chunk.
  - Multiply by 16 to get the rounded-up value.
  - For example, if `sys.argv[2]` is `32`, `(32 + 15) // 16 * 16` gives `32`.


    message = 'capitalize this!'  # 16-byte message to repeat

- `message = 'capitalize this!'`: Defines a 16-byte string message. This will be sent repeatedly to the server.


    print('Sending', bytes, 'bytes of data, in chunks of 16 bytes')

- `print('Sending', bytes, 'bytes of data, in chunks of 16 bytes')`: Prints a message to the console indicating the total 
    number of bytes to be sent and the chunk size.


    s.connect((HOST, PORT))

- `s.connect((HOST, PORT))`: Connects the client socket to the server at the specified host (`127.0.0.1`) and port (`1060`). 
      This establishes the connection.


    sent = 0

- `sent = 0`: Initializes a counter `sent` to track the number of bytes sent.


    while sent < bytes:

- `while sent < bytes:`: Starts a loop that continues until the total number of bytes sent is equal to the number 
    of bytes specified by the user.


        s.sendall(message)

- `s.sendall(message)`: Sends the 16-byte `message` to the server. The `sendall` method ensures that all data is sent.


        sent += len(message)

- `sent += len(message)`: Increments the `sent` counter by the length of the message (16 bytes).


        print('\r%d bytes sent' % (sent,), end='')

- `print('\r%d bytes sent' % (sent,), end='')`: Prints the number of bytes sent so far on the same line, with `\r` returning the 
    cursor to the beginning of the line. The `end=''` argument prevents the print function from adding a newline character at the end.


        sys.stdout.flush()
- `sys.stdout.flush()`: Flushes the output buffer, ensuring that the printed message is immediately visible in the terminal.


    s.shutdown(socket.SHUT_WR)

- `s.shutdown(socket.SHUT_WR)`: Shuts down the writing side of the socket. This signals to the server that the 
    client has finished sending data. The constant `socket.SHUT_WR` means "shutdown the writing side."


    print('Receiving all the data the server sends back')

- `print('Receiving all the data the server sends back')`: Prints a message indicating that the client is now ready to receive data from the server.


    received = 0

- `received = 0`: Initializes a counter `received` to track the number of bytes received.


    while True:

- `while True:`: Starts a loop to continuously receive data from the server.


        data = s.recv(42)

- `data = s.recv(42)`: Receives up to 42 bytes of data from the server. 
    The `recv` method blocks until at least one byte is received or the connection is closed.


        if not received:
            print('The first data received says', repr(data))

- `if not received:`: Checks if this is the first chunk of data received (i.e., if `received` is still 0).
- `print('The first data received says', repr(data))`: Prints the first chunk of data received, using `repr` to show the 
    exact contents, including any special characters.


        received += len(data)

- `received += len(data)`: Increments the `received` counter by the length of the data chunk received.


        if not data:
            break

- `if not data:`: Checks if no data was received, which indicates that the server has closed the connection.
- `break`: Exits the loop if no data is received.


        print('\r%d bytes received' % (received,), end='')

- `print('\r%d bytes received' % (received,), end='')`: Prints the number of bytes received so far on the same line. The `end=''` argument prevents the print function from adding a newline character.

    s.close()

- `s.close()`: Closes the client socket, freeing up the resources associated with it.


else:
    print('usage: tcp_deadlock.py server | client <bytes>', file=sys.stderr)

- `else:`: Handles the case where the script arguments do not match the expected format for either a server or a client.
- `print('usage: tcp_deadlock.py server | client <bytes>', file=sys.stderr)`: Prints a usage message to the standard error stream, 
          indicating how to run the script correctly.

Summary

This client-side code is designed to connect to a server, send a specified number of bytes of data in 16-byte chunks, 
and then receive the processed data back from the server. It handles the connection setup, data transmission, and data reception,
providing detailed status updates throughout the process. The use of command-line arguments allows for flexible testing 
and usage scenarios.
