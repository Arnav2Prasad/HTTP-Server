The term "deadlock" in computer science refers to a situation where two or more programs (or processes) are stuck 
  waiting for each other indefinitely, preventing any progress from being made. This can occur in various contexts, including 
  TCP networking, where poor handling of shared resources can lead to such a scenario.

TCP Buffers and Deadlock

In TCP communication, both the client and server use buffers to temporarily store incoming and outgoing data. 
  These buffers are limited in size and are designed to prevent excessive use of system memory. 
  When these buffers fill up, the system cannot send or receive more data until some of the buffered data is processed.

Client-Server Communication Pattern

In typical client-server communication, as shown in a basic example (referred to as Listing 3-1), the process usually involves:
1. The client sending a message.
2. The server reading the entire message.
3. The server sending a response.
4. The client reading the response.

This pattern ensures that each side reads the data as soon as it is available, 
preventing the buffers from filling up and causing a deadlock.

Potential for Deadlock in TCP Communication

Deadlock can occur if the client and server do not manage their reads and writes properly. 
  For example, if both the client and server attempt to send large amounts of data simultaneously without reading the 
  incoming data from their buffers, the buffers can become full. When the buffers are full, neither side can send 
  more data until some of the buffered data is read and processed. If both sides are waiting to send data and neither is 
  reading, they end up in a deadlock situation.

Example Scenario Leading to Deadlock

Consider a server designed to convert text to uppercase. The server author attempts to handle large requests efficiently 
  by processing data in small chunks (e.g., 1,024 bytes) rather than reading the entire stream at once. However, if both 
  the server and client send large amounts of data without properly coordinating reads and writes, 
  this can lead to deadlock. Hereâ€™s a simplified example:

1. Client sends a large request: The client sends a large chunk of data that exceeds the buffer size.
2. Server reads and processes in chunks: The server reads the first chunk, processes it, and tries to send back the processed data.
3. Buffers fill up: If the servers outgoing buffer becomes full because the client isnt reading the data promptly, and if the 
    client continues to send data without reading the servers response, both buffers (clients outgoing and servers incoming) 
    can become full.
4. Deadlock: Both the client and server are now waiting for the other to read data before they can 
      continue sending more data, resulting in a deadlock.

Listing 3-2 Example

In Listing 3-2, the code might show a more complex client-server interaction where:
- The server reads small blocks of data, processes each block, and sends back the result before reading the next block.
- The client might be sending a continuous stream of data and expecting the server to process and respond simultaneously.

If both the server and client are designed to send and receive data in chunks without a proper synchronization mechanism to 
  ensure they read data promptly, they risk filling their respective buffers and causing a deadlock.

Preventing Deadlock

To prevent deadlock in TCP communication:
- Read Data Promptly: Ensure that both client and server read incoming data as soon as it is available.
- Limit Unacknowledged Data: Avoid sending large amounts of data without receiving acknowledgments or responses.
- Proper Synchronization: Implement synchronization mechanisms to ensure that each side reads and writes data in a coordinated manner.

In summary, deadlock in TCP communication can occur when both the client and server attempt to send large amounts of data without 
  reading the incoming data from their buffers, causing the buffers to fill up and leading to an indefinite wait state. 
  Proper handling of reads and writes, along with effective synchronization, can prevent this issue.
