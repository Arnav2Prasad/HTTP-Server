Server Code

import socket, sys

- `import socket`: Imports the socket module, which provides access to the BSD socket interface. 
    This module is necessary for network communication.
- `import sys`: Imports the sys module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter 
      and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.


s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

- `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`: Creates a new socket object. 
  - `socket.AF_INET`: Specifies the address family for the socket, in this case, IPv4.
  - `socket.SOCK_STREAM`: Specifies the socket type, in this case, a TCP socket (streaming protocol).


HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 1060

- `HOST = '127.0.0.1'`: Sets the server address to localhost (loopback address), meaning the server will only 
          accept connections from the local machine.
- `PORT = 1060`: Sets the port number to 1060, which the server will listen on.

if sys.argv[1:] == ['server']:

- `if sys.argv[1:] == ['server']:`: Checks if the script was run with the argument `server`. `sys.argv` is a list of 
    command-line arguments passed to the script. `sys.argv[1:]` slices the list to get all arguments except the script name.

    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

- `s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)`: Sets the socket option `SO_REUSEADDR` to 1 (true). This allows the 
    socket to bind to an address that is in a `TIME_WAIT` state. It prevents the "address already in use" error during socket binding.


    s.bind((HOST, PORT))

- `s.bind((HOST, PORT))`: Binds the socket to the specified address (host and port). This prepares the server to 
      accept connections on `127.0.0.1:1060`.

    s.listen(1)

- `s.listen(1)`: Enables the server to accept connections. The `1` specifies the maximum number of queued connections. 
      In this case, it can queue 1 connection request.


    while True:

- `while True:`: Starts an infinite loop to keep the server running, allowing it to continuously accept new connections.


        print('Listening at', s.getsockname())

- `print('Listening at', s.getsockname())`: Prints the address the server is listening on. 
        `s.getsockname()` returns the socket's own address.


        sc, sockname = s.accept()

- `sc, sockname = s.accept()`: Waits for an incoming connection. When a connection is received, it returns a new socket 
        object `sc` for the connection and the address `sockname` of the client.


        print('Processing up to 1024 bytes at a time from', sockname)

- `print('Processing up to 1024 bytes at a time from', sockname)`: Prints a message indicating it is processing data from the 
        client at the given address.


        n = 0

- `n = 0`: Initializes a counter `n` to track the number of bytes processed.


        while True:

- `while True:`: Starts another infinite loop to process data from the connected client.


            message = sc.recv(1024)

- `message = sc.recv(1024)`: Receives up to 1024 bytes of data from the client. `sc.recv(1024)` blocks until at 
        least one byte of data is received.


            if not message:
                break

- `if not message:`: Checks if `message` is empty, which indicates the client has closed the connection.
- `break`: Exits the loop if no data is received.


            sc.sendall(message.upper())

- `sc.sendall(message.upper())`: Converts the received message to uppercase and sends it back to the client. `sendall` ensures that 
      all data is sent.


            n += len(message)

- `n += len(message)`: Increments the byte counter `n` by the length of the received message.


            print('\r%d bytes processed so far' % (n,), end='')

- `print('\r%d bytes processed so far' % (n,), end='')`: Prints the number of bytes processed so far on the same line (`\r` returns 
      to the beginning of the line). `end=''` prevents the newline character from being added at the end.


            sys.stdout.flush()

- `sys.stdout.flush()`: Flushes the output buffer, ensuring the message is printed immediately.


        print()

- `print()`: Prints a newline character to move to the next line after the processing loop ends.


        sc.close()

- `sc.close()`: Closes the connection socket `sc`.


        print('Completed processing')

- `print('Completed processing')`: Prints a message indicating the server has completed processing the client's data.


Summary

This script demonstrates a TCP server that processes data in blocks of 1024 bytes and a client that 
sends data in chunks of 16 bytes. It highlights the potential for deadlock if not designed carefully. 
The client sends data to the server, which converts it to uppercase and sends it back. The client then receives the processed data.
