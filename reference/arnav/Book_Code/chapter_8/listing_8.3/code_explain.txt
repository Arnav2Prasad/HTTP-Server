This code snippet demonstrates a small application, `queuecrazy.py`, that utilizes several different message queues 
using ZeroMQ (Ã˜MQ) in Python.

Let's break down the script and explain its components:

1. Importing Libraries:
   - The script begins by importing necessary libraries, including `random`, `threading`, `time`, and `zmq` (ZeroMQ).

2. Initializing ZeroMQ Context:
   - The `zcontext` variable is initialized with a ZeroMQ context, which is used to create sockets for communication.

3. Defining Functions:
   - `fountain(url)`: This function produces a steady stream of words by sending randomly chosen words from lowercase built-in 
            Python functions over a ZeroMQ PUSH socket bound to the specified URL.
   - `responder(url, function)`: This function performs a string operation (specified by the `function` argument, which can 
            be `str.upper` or `str.lower`) on each word received via a ZeroMQ REP socket bound to the specified URL and 
            sends the modified word back.
   - `processor(n, fountain_url, responder_urls)`: This function reads words as they are produced by connecting 
            to the fountain URL, processes them by sending each word to responder URLs for string operation, and 
            prints the processed words along with the processor number (`n`).
   - `start_thread(function, *args)`: This function starts a new thread for the given `function` with optional arguments `args`.

4. Starting Threads:
   - Threads are started for the fountain, two responders (one for uppercase and one for lowercase conversion), and three 
    processors (each assigned a different integer) using the `start_thread` function.

5. Running the Application:
   - The fountain produces a stream of words, the responders process them (either converting to uppercase or lowercase), and 
      the processors receive and print the processed words.
   - The processors are connected to both responder URLs to evenly distribute the workload among the uppercase and lowercase responders.

6. Sleeping:
   - The script sleeps for 30 seconds before exiting to allow time for processing.

In summary, this script demonstrates how multiple threads can communicate via message queues using ZeroMQ. 
It simulates a scenario where a fountain produces words, responders process them, and processors consume and print the processed words, 
  showcasing a simple message queue pattern for distributing workload among multiple workers.
