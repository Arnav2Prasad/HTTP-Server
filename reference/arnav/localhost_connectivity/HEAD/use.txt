In a HEAD request, the server should respond with headers similar to those in a GET request but without a message body.

How to Test

    	Start the Server:
        	Run the server code on your local machine. 
		The server will listen for connections on localhost at port 1080.


    	Send a HEAD Request:
        	Use a tool like curl or Postman to send a HEAD request to the server.
        	Example using curl:
			curl -I http://localhost:1080/your-endpoint

	Server Response:
		The server will send back an HTTP response without a body, including only the headers.

    			HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    			Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    			Content-Length: 0

	
	SUMMARY

    		The server listens for incoming connections on localhost at port 1080.
    		When a connection is received, it processes the HTTP request, generates an appropriate response, 
		and sends it back to the client.
    		The server handles POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD requests, generating different 
		responses based on the request method.
    	
		For HEAD requests, the server sends back only the headers and no body, as required by the HTTP specification.
    		
		The server runs indefinitely, handling one connection at a time.


		This setup allows the server to handle HEAD requests appropriately, responding with the 
		respective headers but no body content.
