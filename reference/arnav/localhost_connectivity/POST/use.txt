OBJECTIVE :  To get hands on with POST request to the server

APPROACH : 
	1. Create form.html (for post request)
	2. python3 server.py
	3. on firefox : type --> file://<pwd>

	for example : file:///home/arnav/git_try1/Computer-Networks/reference/arnav/localhost_connectivity/POST/form.html


We can view and analyze the "request" server recieved and so send the "response"!
