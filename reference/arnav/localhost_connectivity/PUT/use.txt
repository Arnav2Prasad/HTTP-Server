How to Test?

    	Start the Server:
        	Run the server code on your local machine. 
		The server will listen for connections on localhost at port 1080(respective port).


    	Send a PUT Request:
        	Use a tool like curl or Postman to send a PUT request to the server.
        
		Example using curl:
		curl -X PUT http://localhost:1070/your-endpoint -d "test data"


	Server Response:
		The server will print the request details and send back an HTML response 
		indicating it received a PUT request along with the request body.
    		
		The response might look like this in your browser or tool:

        		<html><body><h1>Received PUT Request</h1><p>Request Body: test data</p></body></html>


This setup allows the server to handle both POST and PUT requests appropriately, responding with the respective HTML content.
