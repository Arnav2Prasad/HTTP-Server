1. Tried to send basic GET requests to mis, info.cern.ch servers via python
2. Identified some headers from wireshark packets (referer, accecpt-encoding, connection, host)
3. Viewed apache2 logs, file path /var/log/apache/access.log
   thought of hosting the info.cern.ch website on apache3 server to see the logs by ourselves
4. used $wget -r info.cern.ch to fetch multiple web pages from info.cern.ch, moved this to /var/www/html/
5. hosted the website via apache, on 127.0.0.1

6. typed various requests (using python) of GET and sent them to the hosted website

host header should not contain any path, should only contain host name
for example, 
            127.0.0.1/info.cern.ch  ---> Invalid
            127.0.0.1               ---> Valid
            info.cern.ch            ---> Valid
connection header :
    request sent had connection: keep-alive, but the response from the server had connection: close
    hence we were not able to send multiple requests through the same connection (same code)
    # have to check how to configure apache so that server accepts the keep-alive message, OR check if apache does this for specific req only

trying to see effects of referer on access.log of apache

accept-encodign header :
        python's .decode() method in python gave error for the gzip, deflate of Accept-encoding header
        It worked when we gave it compress, deflate
